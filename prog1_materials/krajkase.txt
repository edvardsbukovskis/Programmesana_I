Piggy Bank
You just returned from a trip to South America. The countries you visited were Colombia, Brazil, and Peru. You arrived back in your country with some foreign currencies from these three countries.

Piggy Bank
Write a C++ program called currency.cpp that prompts the user for the amount of each foreign currency. Your prompts should look like:

Enter number of Colombian Pesos:
Enter number of Brazilian Reais:
Enter number of Peruvian Soles:

Your program should then convert the amount entered by the user and display the total amount of USD. Your final output should look like:

US Dollars = $______

1.
First things first, let’s declare three variables:

pesos for Pesos
reais for Reais
soles for Soles

2.
You’ll need another variable to store the amount you have in dollars.

Let’s declare a variable called dollars.

3.
Compile and execute the code to make sure it’s bug-free before moving on!

4.
You’ll want to ask the user the first question:

Enter number of Colombian Pesos:

5.
You then want the user to type in how much they have and store it in pesos.

6.
Do this for the other two currencies.

Coverting to USD:
7.
Google the conversion rates:

from Pesos to USD
from Reais to USD
from Soles to USD
And write them down in your code using a comment.

8.
Write an equation that solves for the total USD.

This will look something like:

dollars = (conversion_rate1 * currency1) + (conversion_rate2 * currency2) + (conversion_rate3 * currency3)


9.
Display the total amount of USD. Your final output should look like:

US Dollars = $______
