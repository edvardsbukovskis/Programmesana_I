Write a rock_paper_scissors program that:

Prompts the user to select either Rock, Paper, Scissors.
Instructs the computer to randomly select either Rock, Paper, Scissors.
Compares the user’s choice and the computer’s choice and determine the winner.
Informs the user who the winner is.
Note: This project will be particularly challenging due to its complex logic. Beware! Only the brave should venture forth.


1.
Setting up:
2.
Begin by writing a multi-line comment that describes what this program will do.

3.
Let’s create a skeleton for the program. Add:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  
  // Live long and prosper
  
}

4.
In this program, we need a random number for the computer’s choice and we also need to declare an int variable called user for the user’s choice.

So add this line of code at the top:

#include <stdlib.h>

And the code below in main():

srand (time(NULL));
  
int computer = rand() % 3 + 1;

int user = 0;

Now we have a random number that could be 1, 2, or 3 for the computer. And we also have a variable for user’s input.

5.
Before moving on, let’s compile and execute using the terminal to make sure there are no bugs.

Prompt the user to select either Rock, Paper, or Scissors:
6.
We can do something like:

cout << "====================\n";
cout << "rock paper scissors!\n";
cout << "====================\n";

cout << "1) ✊\n";
cout << "2) ✋\n";
cout << "3) ✌️\n";

cout << "shoot! ";

7.
Grab user’s input using std::cin and store it into user.

8.
Now we have both the user’s choice and the computer’s randomized choice, let’s use conditionals & logic to determine the winner.

Make sure to jot down the logic of Rock Paper Scissors on a piece of paper before you start coding.

Take your time!
