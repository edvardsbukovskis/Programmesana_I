The Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry welcomes you! First-year students must go through the annual Sorting Ceremony.

The Sorting Hat is a talking hat at Hogwarts that magically determines which of the four school Houses each new student belongs most to:

gryffindor
hufflepuff
ravenclaw
slytherin
Harry Potter

Write a sortinghat.cpp program that asks the user some questions and places them into one of the four Houses based on their answers!

Setting up:
1.
First things first, let’s create a skeleton for the program:

#include <iostream>

int main() {

  // The magic starts here
  
}

2.
Every time the Muggle-born quiz taker answers a question, they should receive points to one or more Houses.

Let’s declare four int variables:

gryffindor
hufflepuff
ravenclaw
slytherin
And initialize them each to 0.

3.
Let’s declare another four int variables to store each of their answers to the four quiz questions:

answer1
answer2
answer3
answer4

4.
Let’s add a std::cout statement that tells the Muggle that they have started the quiz with the phrase The Sorting Hat Quiz!.

5.
Before moving on, press Save and let’s compile and execute using the terminal to make sure there are no bugs.

6.
And now comes the first question!

Use multiple std::cout statements to display the following question:

Q1) When I'm dead, I want people to remember me as:

  1) The Good
  2) The Great
  3) The Wise
  4) The Bold

7.
Then use std::cin to receive an input from the user.

Store that input in answer1.

8.
Merlin’s beard! We have the user’s answer but now we need… conditionals & logic.

Write a control flow that:

If answer1 == 1, add one point to hufflepuff.

Else if answer1 == 2, add one point to slytherin.

Else if answer1 == 3, add one point to ravenclaw.

Else if answer1 == 4, add one point to gryffindor.

Else, output Invalid input.

9.
Compile and execute using the terminal.

Make sure to debug.

10.
And now do the same thing for question 2:

Q2) Dawn or Dusk?

  1) Dawn
  2) Dusk

And use std::cin to get user’s input and store it in answer2.

11.
However, for this question:

If answer2 == 1, one point to both gryffindor and ravenclaw.

Else if answer2 == 2, one point to both hufflepuff and slytherin.

Else, output the phrase Invalid input.


12.
Do the same thing for question 3:

Q3) Which kind of instrument most pleases your ear?

  1) The violin
  2) The trumpet
  3) The piano
  4) The drum

13.
For this question:

If answer3 == 1, add one to slytherin.

Else if answer3 == 2, add one to hufflepuff.

Else if answer3 == 3, add one to ravenclaw.

Else if answer3 == 4, add one to gryffindor.

Else, output Invalid input.

Question 4) Which road tempts you most?
14.
Do the same thing for question 4:

Q4) Which road tempts you most?

  1) The wide, sunny grassy lane
  2) The narrow, dark, lantern-lit alley
  3) The twisting, leaf-strewn path through woods
  4) The cobbled street lined (ancient buildings)

15.
For this question:

If answer4 == 1, add one to hufflepuff.

Else if answer4 == 2, add one to slytherin.

Else if answer4 == 3, add one to gryffindor.

Else if answer4 == 4, add one to ravenclaw.

Else, output Invalid input.

16.
Now we need to find out which of the four Houses has the highest answer!

We will need another variable called max that starts at 0 and an empty string with:

std::string house;

And to find the maximum:

if (gryffindor > max) {
  
  max = gryffindor;
  house = "Gryffindor";
  
}

if (hufflepuff > max) {

  max = hufflepuff;
  house = "Hufflepuff";
  
}

if (ravenclaw > max) {
  
  max = ravenclaw;
  house = "Ravenclaw";
  
}

if (slytherin > max) {
  
  max = slytherin;
  house = "Slytherin";
  
}

std::cout << house << "!\n";

This also outputs the House.
